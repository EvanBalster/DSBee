# D.S. Bee
![an image of a cheerful yellow bee moving in a sine-wave pattern.](dsbee.png)

A happy little bee that teaches you to program audio (DSP) in C++!



D.S.Bee is a prototyping sandbox that creates very simple VST plugins, and an application to test and interact with those plugins.

It currently supports only Visual Studio and Windows 64-bit configurations.



## Getting Set Up

Install Visual Studio Community 2019.

Download the project via git or ZIP.  Open the project file under VisualStudio and run it.

Edit the example.cpp file to change the way the audio is synthesized.  Feel free to make backups as you go.
